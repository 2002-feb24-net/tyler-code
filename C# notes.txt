data and logic/ behavior are one

Static
does not require on object instance. one copy of that for the whole progroam

non-static /instance
exist on one particular object at a time

Class members private by defaul. Can set them as public instead

Imortant principle: dont repeat yourself  DRY

Day 10
-----------------

Collections
List vs Hash set

List and Hash set - generic, can change size

List - ordered, can have duplicates, based on Array, slow search

Hash set - unordered, can't have duplicates, can't do sort, base on Hashtable
Get it going, create Hash function, takes the element in Hash function gives a random instead
Advantage is  enter something fast, fast to search, check membership, check is almost instantainous, search speed is (0, 1)
Look up Hash function on Google
Get hasCode function is the Hash function   

Bubble sort
Step 1: look at each consecutive particular
step 2: swap them, if they are not in order
Step 3: Rpeat step 1 and 2, until you go a whole pass without any changes

Recursion method
if problem is simple:
    return answer directly
else
break down the problem somewhat
somehow to a pieciesthat are cleser to the base case then to the one we have have right now
Call this method again to solve that simplier case

You use properies when you to other claases to ues the data but with some ristructon 
public inti Rows
{
    get
    {
        return _rows
    }

    set
    {
        // inside a property setter, you have a special keyword "value
        // which is what the code setting teh propery put to the right
        //of the equals sign
        int incoming value = value
        Console.WriteLine("Settings Rows not allowed by)
    }
}

Not a public field, but a public propery

Look up propery, and var

----------------------------------
Big O
searching an array for n value(average in the middle)
foreach i up to n2
if it's the one return 
What does it look like on graph for average time and n2 known as O(n) linear
Bubble sort
It looks at pairs in array and if the second one is greater than the first one, it works O(N 2)
while loop
    inside is for loop 
        O(N) 
any time you have loop is linear is going to O(N2)
3 nesteed loop is N3
